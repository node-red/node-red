    <p>Watches a directory or file for changes.</p>
    <p>You can enter a list of comma separated directories and/or files. You will
    need to put quotes "..." around any that have spaces in.</p>
    <p>On Windows you must use double back-slashes \\ in any directory names.</p>
    <p>The full filename of the file that actually changed is put into <b>msg.payload</b>,
    while a stringified version of the watch list is returned in <b>msg.topic</b>.</p>
    <p><b>msg.file</b> contains just the short filename of the file that changed.</p>
    <p>Of course in Linux, <i>everything</i> is a file and thus can be watched...</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>The directory or file must exist in order to be watched. If the file
    or directory gets deleted it may no longer be monitored even if it gets re-created.</p>
