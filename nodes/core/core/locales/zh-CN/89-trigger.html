<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="trigger">
    <p>Creates two messages on the output separated by a timeout whenever ANY <b>msg</b> arrives on the input.</p>
    <p>For example, this can be used to toggle a Raspberry PI GPIO pin on and off.</p>
    <p>The two output states can be specified as can the duration of the timer.
    Either output can be set to a value, or templated from the inbound
    <b>msg</b> using mustache syntax. <pre>The payload is {{payload}}</pre></p>
    <p>If the payload is an object then setting the output to <i>existing payload</i> will pass the complete payload object through.</p>
    <p>Optionally the timer can be extended by being retriggered... or not.</p>
    <p>By setting the first output to <i>nothing</i>, and selecting extend timer - a watchdog timer can be created.
    No output will happen as long as repeated inputs occur within the timeout period.</p>
    <p>Setting the timer to 0 creates an "infinite" timeout - the first output will happen but the second
    never will, and neither can the first be retriggered - so a true one shot.</p>
    <p>If a <b>msg.reset</b> property is present any timeout currently in progress
    will be cleared and the second output will not happen.</p>
    <p>The blue status icon will be visible while the node is active.</p>
