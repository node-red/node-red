<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="html">
    <p>Extracts elements from an html document held in <b>msg.payload</b> using a selector.</p>
    <p>The selector uses <a href=="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/blob/master/Readme.md" target="_new">Cheerio</a>
     which uses the <a href="https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect#user-content-supported-selectors" target="_new">CSS selector</a> syntax.</p>
    <p>The result can be either a single message with a payload containing an array of the matched elements, or multiple
       messages that each contain a matched element.</p>
