<p>The sidebars can now be split vertically, allowing you to have multiple panels showing at once.</p>
<p>The Info sidebar has been split into two panels; the Explorer panel gives you an overview of your flows and nodes, whilst the Info panel
shows information about the currently selected node or flow.</p>
<p>The default layout has been updated to have the Explorer and Palette sidebars on the left, and for the Debug sidebar to be shown in the lower half
of the right-hand sidebar. Not showing the palette by default is an open question at this point - your feedback is welcome.</p>
