<p>The sidebars have been redesigned to provide a cleaner and more consistent user experience.</p>
<p>Rather than hide them in a dropdown menu, the available sidebars are now listed down each side of the editor.</p>
<p>You can also move the sidebars between the two sides by dragging their buttons around.</p>
<p>We have moved the Information sidebar to the left-hand side to provide a more natural way to navigate around your flows.</p>
<p>This is the first iteration of changes. In a future beta we will add the ability to split the sidebar vertically, so you can have multiple
panels showing at once.</p>

<p>Some of the ways you can pan and zoom around the editor workspace have been improved to provide a more standard way of working.</p>
<p>You can use your middle-mouse button to pan around the workspace, but if you don't have such a button, you can press the spacebar and drag with the left mouse button.</p>
<p>There is also a new 'zoom to fit' button in the status bar; this will set your zoom level to ensure all of your nodes are currently visible.</p>
