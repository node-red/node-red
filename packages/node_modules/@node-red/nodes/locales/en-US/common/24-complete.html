    <p>Trigger a flow when another node completes its handling of a message.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>If a node tells the runtime when it has finished handling a message,
        this node can be used to trigger a second flow.</p>
    <p>For example, this can be used alongside a node with no output port,
        such as the Email sending node, to continue the flow.</p>
    <p>This node must be configured to handle the event for selected nodes in the
        flow. Unlike the Catch node, it does not provide a 'handle all' mode automatically
        applies to all nodes in the flow.</p>
    <p>Not all nodes will trigger this event - it will depend on whether they
        have been implemented to support this feature as introduced in Node-RED 1.0.</p>
