<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="websocket in">
    <p>WebSocket input node.</p>
    <p>By default, the data received from the WebSocket will be in <code>msg.payload</code>.
    The socket can be configured to expect a properly formed JSON string, in which
    case it will parse the JSON and send on the resulting object as the entire message.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="websocket out">
    <p>WebSocket out node.</p>
    <p>By default, <code>msg.payload</code> will be sent over the WebSocket. The socket
    can be configured to encode the entire <code>msg</code> object as a JSON string and send that
    over the WebSocket.</p>

    <p>If the message arriving at this node started at a WebSocket In node, the message
    will be sent back to the client that triggered the flow. Otherwise, the message
    will be broadcast to all connected clients.</p>
    <p>If you want to broadcast a message that started at a WebSocket In node, you
    should delete the <code>msg._session</code> property within the flow.</p>
</script>
