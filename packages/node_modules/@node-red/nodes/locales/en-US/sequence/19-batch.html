    <p>Creates sequences of messages based on various rules.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>There are three modes for creating message sequences:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Number of messages</dt>
        <dd>groups messages into sequences of a given length. The <b>overlap</b>
        option specifies how many messages at the end of one sequence should be
        repeated at the start of the next sequence.</dd>

        <dt>Time interval</dt>
        <dd>groups messages that arrive within the specified interval. If no messages
            arrive within the interval, the node can optionally send on an empty message.</dd>

        <dt>Concatenate Sequences</dt>
        <dd>creates a message sequence by concatenating incoming sequences. Each message
            must have a <code>msg.topic</code> property and a <code>msg.parts</code> property
            identifying its sequence. The node is configured with a list of <code>topic</code>
            values to identify the order sequences are concatenated.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>Storing messages</h4>
    <p>This node will buffer messages internally in order to work across sequences. The
       runtime setting <code>nodeMessageBufferMaxLength</code> can be used to limit how many messages nodes
       will buffer.</p>
</script>
