<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="change">
    <p>Set, change, delete or move properties of a message, flow context or global context.</p>
    <p>The node can specify multiple rules that will be applied in the order they are defined.</p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>The available operations are:</p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>Set</dt>
    <dd>set a property. The value can be a variety of different types, or
            can be taken from an existing message or context property.</dd>
    <dt>Change</dt>
    <dd>search &amp; replace parts of the property. If regular expressions
        are enabled, the "replace with" property can include capture groups, for
        example <code>$1</code>. Replace will only change the type if there
        is a complete match.</dd>
    <dt>Delete</dt>
    <dd>delete a property.</dd>
    <dt>Move</dt>
    <dd>move or rename a property.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The "expression" type uses the <a href="http://jsonata.org/" target="_new">JSONata</a>
    query and expression language.
