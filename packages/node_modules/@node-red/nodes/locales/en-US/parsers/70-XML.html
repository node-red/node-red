    <p>Converts between an XML string and its JavaScript object representation, in either direction.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload<span class="property-type">object | string</span></dt>
        <dd>A JavaScript object or XML string.</dd>

            <ul>
                <li>If the input is a string it tries to parse it as XML and creates a JavaScript object.</li>
                <li>If the input is a JavaScript object it tries to build an XML string.</li>

        <dt class="optional">options <span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>This optional property can be used to pass in any of the options supported by the underlying
            library used to convert to and from XML. See <a href="https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js/blob/master/README.md#options" target="_blank">the xml2js docs</a>
            for more information.</dd>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>When converting between XML and an object, any XML attributes are added as a property named <code>$</code> by default.
    Any text content is added as a property named <code>_</code>. These property names can be specified in the node configuration.</p>
    <p>For example, the following XML will be converted as shown:</p>
    <pre>&lt;p class="tag"&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    <pre>{
  "p": {
    "$": {
      "class": "tag"
    },
    "_": "Hello World"
  }
}</pre>
</script>
