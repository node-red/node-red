<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="json">
    <p>Converts between a JSON string and its JavaScript object representation, in either direction.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload<span class="property-type">object | string</span></dt>
        <dd>A JavaScript object or JSON string.</dd>
        <dt>schema<span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
        <dd>An optional JSON Schema object to validate the payload against.
        The property will be deleted before the <code>msg</code> is sent to the next node.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>payload<span class="property-type">object | string</span></dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>If the input is a JSON string it tries to parse it to a JavaScript object.</li>
                <li>If the input is a JavaScript object it creates a JSON string. The string can optionally be well-formatted.</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt>schemaError<span class="property-type">array</span></dt>
        <dd>If JSON schema validation fails, the catch node will have a <code>schemaError</code> property
            containing an array of errors.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>By default, the node operates on <code>msg.payload</code>, but can be configured
       to convert any message property.</p>
    <p>The node can also be configured to ensure a particular encoding instead of toggling
       between the two. This can be used, for example, with the <code>HTTP In</code>
       node to ensure the payload is a parsed object even if an incoming request
       did not set its content-type correctly for the HTTP In node to do the conversion.</p>
    <p>If the node is configured to ensure the property is encoded as a String and it
       receives a String, no further checks will be made of the property. It will
       not check the String is valid JSON nor will it reformat it if the format option
       is selected.</p>
    <p>For more details about JSON Schema you can consult the specification
    <a href="http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html">here</a>.</p>
