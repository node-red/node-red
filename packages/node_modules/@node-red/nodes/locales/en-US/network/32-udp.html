<script type="text/html" data-help-name="udp in">
    <p>A UDP input node, that produces a <code>msg.payload</code> containing a
    Buffer, string, or base64 encoded string. Supports multicast.</p>
    <p>It also provides <code>msg.ip</code> and <code>msg.port</code> set to the
    ip address and port from which the message was received.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>On some systems you may need root or administrator access
      to access ports below 1024.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>If your node shows "inbound connections are disabled", then 
      it has been disabled in the Node-RED settings file.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/html" data-help-name="udp out">
    <p>This node sends <code>msg.payload</code> to the designated UDP host and port. Supports multicast.</p>
    <p>You may also use <code>msg.ip</code> and <code>msg.port</code> to set the destination values, but the statically configured values have precedence.</p>
    <p>If you select broadcast either set the address to the local broadcast ip address, or maybe try 255.255.255.255, which is the global broadcast address.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: On some systems you may need to be root to use ports below 1024 and/or broadcast.</p>
