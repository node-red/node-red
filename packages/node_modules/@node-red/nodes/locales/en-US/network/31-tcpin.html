<script type="text/html" data-help-name="tcp in">
    <p>Provides a choice of TCP inputs. Can either connect to a remote TCP port,
        or accept incoming connections.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>On some systems you may need root or administrator access
    to access ports below 1024.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>If your node shows "inbound connections are disabled", then 
        it has been disabled in the Node-RED settings file.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/html" data-help-name="tcp out">
    <p>Provides a choice of TCP outputs. Can either connect to a remote TCP port,
    accept incoming connections, or reply to messages received from a TCP In node.</p>
    <p>Only the <code>msg.payload</code> is sent.</p>
    <p>If <code>msg.payload</code> is a string containing a Base64 encoding of binary
    data, the Base64 decoding option will cause it to be converted back to binary
    before being sent.</p>
    <p>If <code>msg._session</code> is not present the payload is
    sent to <b>all</b> connected clients.</p>
    <p>In Reply-to mode, setting <code>msg.reset = true</code> will reset the connection
        specified by _session.id, or all connections if no _session.id is specified.</p>
    <p><b>Note: </b>On some systems you may need root or administrator access
    to access ports below 1024.</p>
</script>

<script type="text/html" data-help-name="tcp request">
    <p>A simple TCP request node - sends the <code>msg.payload</code> to a server tcp port and expects a response.</p>
    <p>Connects, sends the "request", and reads the "response". It can either count a number of
    returned characters into a fixed buffer, match a specified character before returning,
    wait a fixed timeout from first reply and then return, sit and wait for data, or send then close the connection
    immediately, without waiting for a reply.</p>
    <p>If in sit and wait mode (remain connected) you can send <code>msg.reset = true</code> or <code>msg.reset = "host:port"</code> to force a break in
    the connection and an automatic reconnection.</p>
    <p>The response will be output in <code>msg.payload</code> as a buffer, so you may want to .toString() it.</p>
    <p>If you leave tcp host or port blank they must be set by using the <code>msg.host</code> and <code>msg.port</code> properties in every message sent to the node.</p>
