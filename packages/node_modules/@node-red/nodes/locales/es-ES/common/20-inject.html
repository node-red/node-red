<script type="text/html" data-help-name="inject">
<p>Injects a message into a flow either manually or at regular intervals. The message
payload can be a variety of types, including strings, JavaScript objects or the current time.</p>
<h3>Outputs</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>payload<span class="property-type">various</span></dt>
    <dd>The configured payload of the message.</dd>
    <dt class="optional">topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>An optional property that can be configured in the node.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>The Inject node can initiate a flow with a specific payload value.
The default payload is a timestamp of the current time in millisecs since January 1st, 1970.</p>
<p>The node also supports injecting strings, numbers, booleans, JavaScript objects, or flow/global context values.</p>
<p>By default, the node is triggered manually by clicking on its button within the editor. It can also be set to
inject at regular intervals or according to a schedule.</p>
<p>It can also be configured to inject once each time the flows are started.</p>
<p>The maximum <i>Interval</i> that can be specified is about 596 hours / 24 days. However if you are looking at intervals
greater than one day you should consider using a scheduler node that can cope with power outages and restarts.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: The <i>"Interval between times"</i> and <i>"at a specific time"</i> options use the standard cron system.
This means that 20 minutes will be at the next hour, 20 minutes past and 40 minutes past - not in 20 minutes time.
If you want every 20 minutes from now - use the <i>"interval"</i> option.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: To include a newline in a string you must use the Function or Template node to create the payload.</p>
